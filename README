The goal of this PHP function is get all the data from a HTML form and generate a MySQL INSERT query statement.
To test this function, you need two files:
1. The page with the HTML form, form.php
2. The PHP file with the function, function.php

The function expects some parameters:
1. Names of fields to be ignored from the form
2. Alternate names of form fields when generating the database column names
3. Names of database fields which contain numerical data
4. Native PHP functions to apply to the form data before adding it to the query
5. A separator for handling multi select form data

This function makes it possible to have a form which has different field names from the database table columns.
